## Find a Provider API

This is the server code that runs on a server I built, it pulls the Accounts from ZohoCRM and checks if they have various flags before adding geocoding the address from Google Maps API and adding to the Database

## Dashboard

I recently added a Dashboard that allows adding or editing the Accounts with a Sync Override to prevent edits from being changed.

I also recently added the ability to pull Accounts in Canada and Geocode those correctly.

There is alot of things I wish I did different when I built this but I was under a serious timeframe and small budget and the client made changes every other day.

This feeds the Wordpress plugin which is on their [main website](https://www.cartessaaesthetics.com/find-a-provider) along with 4 or 5 microsites such as [Cool-Peel](https://cool-peel.com/find-a-provider/) and [VirtueRF](https://virtuerf.com/find-a-physician/) the Microsites only show that one product.
