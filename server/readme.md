## Find a Provider API

This is the API that runs on it's own server and pulls the Accounts from ZohoCRM API, checks they have certain flags and using Google's Map API fetchs the Lat and Lng so they can be displayed on the front end which is a wordpress plugin.

## Dashboard

I recently added a Dashboard that allows adding and editing the accounts with a sync over-ride to prevent them from being overwritten.
